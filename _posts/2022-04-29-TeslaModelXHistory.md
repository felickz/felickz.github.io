            Concern: Customer states: Right falcon wing door shows obstacle detected warning when opening only slightly most of 
            the time. Other times it would open normally but would never fully extend. After last attempt to open from the outside 
            handle, the top door glass interfered with roof and cracked.
            Verified customer concern. Identified RH rear door aft hinge spring dislodged. Replaced both RH rear door hinge springs, 
            spine applique carrier, spine applique, RH rear door primary seal & RH rear door upper glass. Performed RH rear door 
            adjustment for proper fitment of replacement roof glass. Performed water leak test & verified no water ingress at RH rear 
            door. Performed test drive & verified no wind noise from RH rear door. Performed function check & verified proper 
            operation of RH rear door.
