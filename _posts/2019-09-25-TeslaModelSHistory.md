# Background  
  
  I purchased my 2013 Tesla Model S P85+ used with ~53,000 miles in late 2017.  This was my first experience buying a car: #1 sight unseen, #2 online, and #3 from Tesla.  All three of those things made for quite the experence! I had been following along cloesly online with how the process would go and therefore none of this was surprising to me in any way.  I was immediatly alerted when a Tesla for sale listing hit my specific criteria using my trusty Tesla price scraper [EV-CPO Hunter](https://ev-tsla.com/hunter/index.php).  I got the alert about my unicorn vehicle being available on the drive home from a barbeque.  I immediatly pulled over into a Wendy's parking lot, stared at the listing for 2-3 minutes on my phone, and then clicked the buy button! Then the wait started... almost exactly at the 12 week mark I picked up my S at my local-ish Tesla Service Center!
  
  The higher milage and vehicle age really healped keep the sale price reasonable for meeting my criteria to purchase.  Compared to what the vehicle cost new, I was getting a REALLY good deal. Luckilly Tesla had just rolled out selling higher milage cars (50k+) as Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) that carried a 2 year warranty (as opposed to the lower milage 4 year CPO waranty).  In the CPO program, the vehicles were subjected to a detailed inspection process that was later phased out over the years in favor of a less detailed "Tesla Used" certification process.  I can attest to this level of detail as I was able to get information (one way or another) that the drive unit was replaced.  Further, it was obvious that at least the hood of the vehicle was re-painted as there was quite a bit of overspray on some nuts.
  
  The "CPO" 2 year Warranty WELL worth it for a 2013 Model S!  Since 2013 was an early production model year for the Model S many problems surfaced.  Items such as the door handles needed to be repaired multiple times to fix long standing issues while parts were being re-designed.
