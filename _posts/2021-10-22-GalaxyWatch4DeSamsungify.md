## Jonesin for that Pixel Watch?

### Steps to migrate your Galaxy Watch 4 less Samsung and more Google

1. Install Google Fit
1. Install GPay app -  but can't yet bind it to the hold down button that launches Samsung pay ( reports latest firmware broke gpay)
1. go into Samsung Fitness app and turn off every setting to avoid getting alerts

### Issues
1. Cannot uninstall some of the Samsung apps, that is a little annoying.
1. Cannot use Wear OS app from phone - must use Galaxy Wear companion app
1. Fit does not support ECG features - but heart rate does work
1. Google Assistant is not officially supported yet... but hints that it is coming
