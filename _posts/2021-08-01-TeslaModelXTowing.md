Best efficiency drive I had so far

## 22" vs 20" OEM wheel options
One of the first "de-modifications" I performed when I started towing regularly was to get rid of my 22" wheels.  They are heavier and have a significant decrease in range (for me ~20% reduction), even when not towing.  Further, they also have a reduced weight capacity ( though only towing a popup was not an issue for me) along with a harsher ride.

2021 - 570 Wh/Mile

As you can see, a more direct highway route used 9% more battery with minimal time savings (not accounting for traffic conditions here). Notable conditions 
* 8 degrees hotter
* 4 MPH windier

# Towing 

Towing the camper is much more stressful then anything EV related. Lots of creeks and clunks coming from the camper have you constantly checking camera/mirrors.  Most notably the worst scenario:

Planning out your trip with [A Better Route Planner](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/) can take some of the guesswork out of figuring out far you can go without a stop at a charger.  The best way to estimate is to get a good handle of your Wh/Mile and plug those values into the app.  I find myself forcing the routes onto side roads if I want to stretch out the trip.  I also map out a point of no return such that if I make a specific charger less then my estimated value, I had better stop to play it safe.  It is also worth noting that the Tesla nav system does a pretty good job of staying close to ABRP estimates and routes.
